# About This Game

In the wake of the Cataclismo, lead the remaining survivors as a shattered world threatens to annihilate the last vestiges of humanity. Construct fortresses brick by brick, crafting elaborate structures from wood and stone to withstand relentless waves of Horrors intent on overwhelming your group of survivors. Command powerful units in a steadfast defense, skillfully coordinating their unique abilities as you move from breach to breach. Venture into the unknown to gather crucial resources necessary for expanding your military strength and construction capabilities as you hold the line against an unyielding onslaughtâ€”siege after siege, night after night.

Far from the temporary safety of the Last City, your strongholds and outposts are the first line of defense against the Horror hordes, preventing them from reaching the heart of humanity. Utilize a sophisticated building system to create impenetrable fortresses across diverse biomes, allowing you full creative freedom to strategize and adapt your defenses based on the environment. Leverage natural chokepoints, elevation advantages, and available resources to prepare for the challenges each nightâ€™s attack presents.

* A versatile building system enables you to construct your fortresses precisely as you envisionâ€”piece by piece, with blueprints of your own design or by utilizing community-created structures. Use the resources you've gathered to build access points to previously inaccessible areas of the map, or erect fortifications that restrict the Horrors while providing your troops with safe vantage spots.

* Opt to build rapidly and cost-effectively with wood, or establish quarries and employ robust stone to endure the assaults. Monitor structural integrity and load-bearing columns closely, as collapsing elements can eliminate both allies and adversaries alike, frequently creating unique opportunities to defeat multiple foes through tactical vulnerabilities.

* Adjust your fortress to meet evolving demands by acquiring new tools and developing strategies to secure the resources necessary for a formidable defensive force. Optimize transportation routes from resource sites to your storage facilities with thoughtfully placed structures, and make the most of limited space through rooftop construction.
